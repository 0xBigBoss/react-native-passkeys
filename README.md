# React Native Passkeys

This is a module to help you create and authenticate with passkeys on ios, android & web with the same api. The library aims to stay close to the standard [`navigator.credentials`](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/#framework-credential-management). More specifically, we provide an api for `get` & `create` functions (since these are the functions available cross-platform).

The adaptations we make are simple niceties like providing automatic conversion of base64-url encoded strings to buffer. This is also done to make it easier to pass the values to the native side.

Further niceties include some flag functions that indicate support for certain features.
